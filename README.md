This is a simple app created using MERN (React as client-side; Express, Node as server-side and MongoDB as a database). Here I implemented the CRUD application and Real-time Login Registration system with Email, Google and Github using Firebase and distributed Admin, User role. Also I secured data using Private Route from Client side and JWT token from server side. In this app patients can apply for appointment of the doctors in a particular date and time. Doctors can see who are their patients and manage the schedule as well. Check it out!
